          In between the years of 1810 and 1819 came the war of 1812. This changed the path that Canada was going to take even though this war didnâ€™t benefit Canada. If this war was to be removed from our history books Canada wouldn't be what it is now. Before the revolutionary war in  1775-1783 the British government promised to respect the sovereignty of the united States. However, after the revolutionary war had passed, a lot of British elites  remained skeptical of that the american experiment would even last.
